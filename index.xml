      <description>If you’ve ever been to a major league baseball game, you know that home runs are one of the best parts of the game. They’re fun to watch, and often times the team with the most homers wins the game. The long ball doesn’t always tell the whole story though. Of the MLB champions in the last 15 seasons, only 5 have ranked in the top 8 in home runs during the regular season.</description>

      <description>There seemed to have been quite a few big upsets in this year’s NCAA Men’s Basketball March Madness tournament, but they don’t call it March Madness for nothing. There usually is a decent amount of top teams going home earlier than they wanted to, anticipated to, and were projected to. So how surprised, or upset should we really be? Shouldn’t we expect this to happen? Let’s take a look.</description>
